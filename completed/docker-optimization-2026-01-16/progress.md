**Iteration**: 0
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Task**: Refactor .cursorrules for optimal agent performance

---

## Task Overview

**Goal**: Refactor 695-line `.cursorrules` file to ~200 lines of core rules, extracting specialized content to knowledge base files.

**Strategy**:
- Extract Ralph, Docker, PowerShell, verification, communication content to `_agent_knowledge/`
- Add priority hierarchy (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
- Add quick reference index
- Ingest all to Local RAG
- Zero information loss - reorganization only
